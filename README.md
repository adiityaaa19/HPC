- **sequentialthinking**
  - A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.<br/>This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.<br/>Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.<br/><br/>When to use this tool:<br/>- Breaking down complex problems into steps<br/>- Planning and design with room for revision<br/>- Analysis that might need course correction<br/>- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially<br/>- Problems that require a multi-step solution<br/>- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps<br/>- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out<br/><br/>Key features:<br/>- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress<br/>- You can question or revise previous thoughts<br/>- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end<br/>- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches<br/>- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack<br/>- Generates a solution hypothesis<br/>- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps<br/>- Repeats the process until satisfied<br/>- Provides a correct answer<br/><br/>Parameters explained:<br/>- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:<br/>* Regular analytical steps<br/>* Revisions of previous thoughts<br/>* Questions about previous decisions<br/>* Realizations about needing more analysis<br/>* Changes in approach<br/>* Hypothesis generation<br/>* Hypothesis verification<br/>- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end<br/>- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)<br/>- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)<br/>- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking<br/>- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered<br/>- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point<br/>- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)<br/>- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed<br/><br/>You should:<br/>1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust<br/>2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts<br/>3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"<br/>4. Express uncertainty when present<br/>5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths<br/>6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step<br/>7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate<br/>8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps<br/>9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution<br/>10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output<br/>11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached
